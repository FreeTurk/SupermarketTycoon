## Gameplay Mechanics

The game is straightforward but requires strategic mastery to succeed. Here’s how it works:

- **Product Restocking:** The player needs to restock products to ensure a continuous supply of goods to sell. 
- **Daily Customer Count:** The number of daily customers is influenced by:
  - **Expiration Date:** Products closer to expiration may affect customer interest.
  - **Pricing:** Competitive pricing increases customer attraction.
  
- **Setting Prices:**  
   - To set or update prices, double-click on an item’s price, edit the amount, and press "Enter" to save.

- **Licenses and Seasonal Items:**  
   - Buy licenses (e.g., seafood) to expand the range of available products.
   - Seasonal items, like ice cream in winter, boost sales during specific times.

- **Energy and Actions:**  
   - Each day, players have a limit of 10 actions, which can be increased by purchasing energy upgrades.

## Objective

The goal is to make efficient decisions daily to avoid bankruptcy. Key objectives include:
- **Earning Profits:** Ensure a positive daily cash flow.
- **Avoiding Bankruptcy:** There’s a recurring expense of $100 every 10 days, so ensure earnings exceed this amount to stay afloat.
